# Contributing

Keep changes focused and state which component they affect. Include the
Omarchy, Quickshell, pam-u2f and libfido2 versions relevant to your change.
Never attach enrollment data, encrypted secret stores, accessibility dumps or
unredacted journals. Use synthetic credentials and generic device labels.

## Development checks

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --workspace --locked
node --test tests/*.test.cjs
python3 scripts/check-publication.py
python3 scripts/sync-i18n.py --check
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
for script in install.sh scripts/install-plugins.sh scripts/build-pam-gate.sh luks/zzzz-omarchy-yubikey-luks.conf; do
  bash -n "$script"
done
```

On a compatible Omarchy installation, also run:

```sh
python3 scripts/test-language-ui.py
python3 scripts/test-control-ui.py --language de
python3 scripts/test-control-ui.py --language pt-BR --width 640
omarchy plugin validate plugins/yubikey.lock
omarchy plugin validate plugins/yubikey.polkit
```

The Rust tests cover encrypted-store round trips, tamper/wrong-key rejection
and file permissions. JavaScript tests cover the Polkit prompt model and lock
authentication routing. Python tests cover PAM planning, mapping merges,
backups, rollback, interrupted writes and plugin-copy behavior. CI cannot
establish real hardware authentication or safe session-lock recovery. Describe
manual checks separately and do not claim a hardware route was tested when
only a mock or static check ran.

Native PAM tests need Linux-PAM headers and a C compiler (Arch: `base-devel pam`;
Debian/Ubuntu: `build-essential libpam0g-dev`). The Rust Secret Service contract test needs `dbus-daemon`
(Arch/Debian/Ubuntu: `dbus`) and starts its own private bus with synthetic data. They load the actual fallback gate
in an isolated `pam_start_confdir` stack with synthetic key/password modules,
never the system authentication configuration. Signed-transfer tests use disposable
OpenSSH keys and real `ssh-keygen -Y` signatures. No real mappings belong in fixtures.

LUKS tests use synthetic metadata and mocked commands. Never point a test at a
real disk or hardware key. Enrollment and boot-image/reboot qualification are
separate manual checks; preserve the passphrase and a bootable fallback image.

Test lock changes on a disposable profile or recoverable machine, while keeping
password access available. Do not replace the active lock implementation during
a locked session. Changes to relying-party IDs or crypto contexts require an
explicit enrollment migration plan.

Translation changes must preserve placeholder parity and confirmation literals.
Run the catalog generator and its checks before committing. Test right-to-left
layouts and long labels when changing translated UI. Multi-user changes need
coverage for unrelated account entries and conflicting rollback.

## Writing conventions

Use English for source comments, canonical messages and developer documentation.
Keep user-facing translations in the catalogs described in
[Languages](docs/languages.md). Keep wording concise and consistent: use
"security key" for generic FIDO2 devices, "YubiKey" for the product, and
"keyring password" and "FIDO2 PIN" for the two distinct secrets. Comments should
explain intent, constraints or non-obvious behavior, and match the implementation.

Preserve the MIT license and Omarchy attribution. Security findings belong in
the private reporting channel, not a public issue.
