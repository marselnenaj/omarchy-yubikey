## Why this exists

You already have a security key on your desk. Use a touch to approve `sudo`,
authorize a privileged desktop action or unlock your screen, with a password
available when the key is absent.

**Omarchy YubiKey** brings these pieces together: PAM configuration examples,
a native setup and management window, a theme-aware Polkit agent, a session-lock plugin and an optional Rust helper.
Choose the parts you need. The PAM route also works without the plugins.

## What you get

| Component | What it does | Start here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Setup & management** | One window for status, setup, backup keys, desktop, Keyring and recovery | [Control center](docs/control-center.md) |
| **Passwordless sudo** | PIN plus touch by default; confirm before using the existing password stack | [PAM setup](docs/pam-setup.md) |
| **Polkit dialog** | Show the actual PAM PIN/password prompt and an explicit fallback choice | [Shell plugins](docs/plugins.md) |
| **Screen unlock** | Select key/PIN, password or optional fingerprint without automatic method switching | [Shell plugins](docs/plugins.md) |
| **Optional Git transfer** | Sign enrollment snapshots; verify pinned trust, review changes and reject old imports | [Enrollment sync](docs/enrollment-sync.md) |
| **50 languages** | Follow the account's Omarchy language, with live shell updates and English fallback | [Languages](docs/languages.md) |
| **Multiple accounts** | Keep enrollment and user data separate; review shared PAM changes | [Multiple users](docs/multi-user.md) |
| **GNOME Keyring** | Decrypt a saved keyring password with the key's `hmac-secret`, then unlock over D-Bus | [Keyring helper](docs/keyring.md#gnome-keyring) |
| **OpenPGP card** | Import the key on the card into GnuPG, trust it, or remove it again without losing secrets | [OpenPGP card](docs/openpgp.md) |
| **Resident SSH keys** | Copy the SSH keys stored on the key into `~/.ssh` without overwriting files, and set up the git hosts named by their application | [SSH keys](docs/ssh.md) |
| **LUKS2 boot unlock** | Enroll disk-unlock keys with PIN plus touch; integrate boot separately with a manual guide | [LUKS setup](docs/luks.md) |

**Passwordless PAM and the optional helper work differently.** PAM verifies a
security-key assertion. The helper recovers an existing password from an
encrypted local store. It does not add native passkey login to GNOME Keyring.

## Getting started

Install the complete Omarchy plugin and open its setup window:

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/marselnenaj/omarchy-yubikey.git
omarchy plugin enable yubikey.setup
omarchy-shell shell summon yubikey.setup '{}'
```

Use the key button in your bar to reopen it. **Adding the plugin does not change
authentication.** The window shows local status and opens explicit terminal
operations for setup and management. PINs and passwords stay in the terminal.
[Control center, dependencies and removal](docs/control-center.md).

<p align="center"><img src="preview.png" alt="Omarchy YubiKey control center with synthetic example status." width="100%"></p>

The control center is **0.5.2**, with OpenPGP-card and resident SSH-key management.
Its interface is in English, German and Brazilian Portuguese, with English
fallback; the existing authentication components retain their 50-language support.
The standalone lock/Polkit plugins remain 0.3.0 and the Rust helper remains 0.2.0.

For terminal-only setup, clone the current source and run `./install.sh`.
The wizard lets you choose sudo, desktop authentication and optional GNOME Keyring
unlock. It installs needed packages, enrolls your key, backs up changed files and
walks you through password/key checks. **Keep a separate recovery root shell open
until the checks pass.** [Installation and rollback](docs/install.md) explains each step.

LUKS enrollment is a separate opt-in command: `./install.sh --luks --device /dev/your-luks-partition`.
It requests PIN plus touch and preserves the disk passphrase. Boot configuration
is a manual step; read the [LUKS guide](docs/luks.md) first.

The **v0.5.2 release** provides [source and checksums](https://github.com/marselnenaj/omarchy-yubikey/releases/tag/v0.5.2).
The [release notes](docs/releases/0.5.2.md) describe reviewed dependency updates,
component versions and validation.
For manual setup or a custom PAM stack, see [PAM setup](docs/pam-setup.md).
New PAM setup defaults to PIN plus touch and explicit password fallback.
Touch-only and automatic fallback remain deliberate installer choices. Existing
installations need a reviewed installer rerun; updating source alone does not
change PAM. The optional Keyring helper remains touch-only. See the
[security model](docs/security-model.md).

### Requirements and compatibility

| Part | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| PAM | Arch Linux, `pam-u2f`, Linux-PAM headers/C compiler for explicit fallback; FIDO2 key with a configured PIN for default PIN mode |
| Control center | Compatible Omarchy 4 plugin host, Python 3 and `omarchy-launch-terminal`; PAM/Keyring setup offers package installation after terminal confirmation; LUKS prerequisites are documented separately |
| Shell plugins | Omarchy 4 with the Quickshell plugin host, `qs.Commons`, `qs.Ui`, authentication-clone support and the shell's PAM/Polkit modules |
| Rust helper | Linux, Rust/Cargo, libfido2, OpenSSL, libudev, pkg-config and Clang build tools; a FIDO2 key with `hmac-secret` |
| Keyring | GNOME Keyring on the user's session bus and an existing default collection |
| LUKS | Existing LUKS2 volume, known passphrase, FIDO2 `hmac-secret` key with PIN, cryptsetup/systemd/libfido2; boot guide targets reviewed mkinitcpio/Limine setups |

The source environment used Omarchy **4.0.6**, libfido2 **1.17.0** and pam-u2f
**1.4.0**. Other shell versions and security-key models are unqualified. A key
that works with PAM may lack the extension needed by the Rust helper. NFC and
other desktops are not qualified.

## Individual shell plugins

The [control center](docs/control-center.md) is the complete entry point; its guided installer prepares authentication. If PAM is already configured,
there are also standalone source repositories for the
[Polkit agent](https://github.com/marselnenaj/omarchy-yubikey-polkit) and
[lock screen](https://github.com/marselnenaj/omarchy-yubikey-lock). Each has a
root manifest for standard `omarchy plugin add` installation. Follow their
installation and removal instructions; do not install a second copy over a
plugin already managed by the suite. Marketplace approval is separate from a
GitHub release and is not a security certification.

## Build and check

On Arch, install build dependencies:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel pam openssh rust clang pkgconf libfido2 openssl systemd-libs
cargo build --release --locked
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo fmt --all -- --check
node --test tests/*.test.cjs
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
python3 scripts/check-publication.py
```

See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full development checks. Automated
tests use synthetic credentials and isolated authentication stacks; hardware
authentication and session recovery require separate manual validation.
